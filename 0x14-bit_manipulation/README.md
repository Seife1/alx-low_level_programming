## Bit manipulation in C
========================================================
* Bit Manipulation referes to the process of manipulating individual bits with in a binary number.
* This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as memory optimization, Faster execution, bit-level control, bit masking

In C, bit manipulation can be achieved using bitwise operators. These operators include:

AND (&)
OR (|)
XOR (^)
NOT (~)
Left shift (<<)
Right shift (>>)

# What do these bitwise operators do?

	| can be used to enable a bit.
	& can be used to disable a bit
	^ can be used to toggle a bit
	<< and >> are used to move bits.
