File handling in C is a way to work with files on the disk.

1. Stream oriented data files:
	The data is stored in the same manner as it appears on the screen.
2. System oriented data files :
	The files are more closely associated with the OS.

## C-File Operations

Creation of a new file, opening, reading, writing in a file, closing a file.
## Steps for processing a file.

1. Declare a file pointer variable
2. open a file using fopen()
3. Process the file using the suitable function
